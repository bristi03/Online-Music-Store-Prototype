# Online-Music-Store-Prototype
AudioWaves is an online music store devoloped with Python Flask and HTML, CSS and JavaScript. User must sign-up and login to stream music. After logging in the user can stream songs with general functionalities like play, pause, forward (plays next song), backward (plays previous song) and seek through the music to play specific part of a song, control volume. They can choose playback mode between shuffle (next song chosen randomly) and repeat (current song repeated). User can browse music by song/artist name. This is still in a prototype stage, more functionalities will be added.
